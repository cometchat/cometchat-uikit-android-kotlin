# CometChat UIKit for Android Kotlin (Legacy)

## Important Notice
As of August 30th, 2023, CometChat will no longer be providing a separate UIKit for Kotlin apps. We encourage all developers to utilize the [CometChat UIKit for Android](https://github.com/cometchat/cometchat-uikit-android) which is fully compatible with Kotlin applications. This repository will be maintained as a legacy reference but will not receive further updates. We apologize for any inconvenience and thank you for your understanding.

## Migration to CometChat Android Java UIKit
If you were using the Kotlin UIKit, migrating to the Java UIKit is straightforward. The Java UIKit is designed to work seamlessly with both Java and Kotlin Android apps, ensuring you can integrate the same rich set of features without any hassle.

To integrate the Java UIKit into your Kotlin application, please follow the steps provided in the [CometChat UIKit for Android documentation](https://www.cometchat.com/docs/android-uikit/integration#get-started).

## Support & Assistance
If you need help with the migration or have any questions regarding the use of the Java UIKit within your Kotlin app, please reach out to our support team at [CometChat Support](https://help.cometchat.com/hc/en-us).

We are committed to providing high-quality support to ensure a smooth transition and continued performance for your applications.

## Legacy Repository Reference
The contents of this repository are preserved for historical purposes and reference for projects that have been built using this version of the CometChat UIKit for Kotlin. However, we strongly recommend updating to the latest version of the [CometChat Android Java UIKit](https://github.com/cometchat/cometchat-uikit-android) to benefit from new features, improvements, and support.
